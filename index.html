        <h1>Getting Help<button id="dismiss">X</button></h1>
        <p>For urgent communication with the instructor and the teaching assistant, it is best to send an email (preferred) or give a phone call. If you want to talk to any of them in person, remember that their posted office hours are merely nominal times when they guarantee that they will be in their offices. You are always welcome to visit them outside of their office hours if you need help or want to talk about the course. </p>
        <br/>
        <p>We ask that you follow a few simple guidelines. The instructor normally works with his office door being open. Whenever the office door is open, he welcomes visits from students. However, if his office door is closed, this means that he is busy with meetings or phone calls, thus prefers not to be disturbed.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>We will use the course webpage as the central repository for all information about the class. Through the webpage, you can: </p>
        <br/>
        <ol>
            <li>Obtain copies of any handouts or assignments. This is especially useful if you miss a class or lose a document. </li>
            <li>View announcements that relate to the course. </li>
            <li>Find links to any electronic data you need for your assignments. </li>
            <li>Read clarifications and changes made to any assignments, schedules, or policies. </li>
        </ol>
        <!-- <p>Lastly, you can use Piazza for asking questions and receiving answers without all the emails! Posting your questions on Piazza will help the whole class benefit and will certainly avoid redundancy.

                <h3>About the Course</h3>
                <p>C++ is a <b>general programming language</b> that supports 
  			<b>various</b> computer 
  			programming <b>models</b> such as <b>object-oriented</b> programming and 
  			<b>generic</b> programming. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup and,
  			“Its main purpose was to make writing good programs easier 
  			and more pleasant for the programmer.”
		  <p> By learning C++, you can create applications that will run
		  on a wide variety of hardware platforms such as personal 
		  computers running Windows, Linux, UNIX, and Mac OS X, 
		  as well as small form factor hardware such as IoT 
		  devices like the Raspberry PI and Arduino–based boards.

            <h3>Final Grade Assignment and Assessment methods</h3>
            <p>To this end, the below table shows the breakdown of the five forms of activities that the course involves, alongside the quantity and the overall weight of each activity. Take into account that small differences in scores can make the difference between two letter grades. Letter grades will be determined by absolute standards. The total score will be plotted as a histogram. Cutoff points are determined by examining the quality of students' work on the borderlines. Individual cases, especially those near the cutoff points may be adjusted upward or downward based on factors such as attendance, class participation, improvement observed throughout the course, exam performance, and special circumstances</p>

            <p>You are encouraged to submit the projects on time. For all projects except the final one, the following rules apply:
                <p/>
                <ul>
                    <li> If you submit one day late, we will deduct 25% of the project score as a penalty. </li>
                    <li>If you submit two days late, 50% will be deducted. </li>
                    <li>The project will not be graded (and you will receive a zero score on it) if you are more than two days late. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Grace days</h4>
                <p>There is a grace-days quota for projects. In particular, you will be given <b>3</b> grace days for all projects, except for the final one. You can use the grace days as needed. For instance, you can submit your first project three days late and still receive no penalty. In this case, you will be penalized starting from the 4th day after the deadline. Furthermore, when you consume all your grace days, you will be left with no grace days for the rest of the projects.</p>
                <br/>

                <h4>Final project</h4>

                <p>Note that the final project is unique in two aspects. First, you cannot cannot use grace days for it. As such, if you are left with some grace days before the final project, you will lose them all. Hence, plan how to utilize your grace-days quota judiciously.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Second, there will not be any penalty system for this project either. More precisely, if you are one day late in submitting the project, it will not be graded and you will receive a zero score on it.</p>

            <h1>Policies</h1>
            <h3>Working Alone on Assignments/Projects</h3>
            <p>Assignments/projects that are assigned to students should be performed individually. This course does not include any team projects or assignments.</p>

            <h3>Handing in Assignments/Projects</h3>
            <p>All assignments/projects are due at 11:59PM (one minute before midnight) on the specified due date. All submissions are electronic and should be submitted using <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/410924" target="_blank">Gradescope</a>'s course page. </p>
            <p>
                Refer to the following link for how to submit your solutions to Gradescope: <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/get_started#student-submission" target="_blank">https://www.gradescope.com/get_started#student-submission</a>
            </p>

            <h3>Making up Exams, Assignments and Projects</h3>
            <p>Missed exams, assignments and projects can be made up on a case by case basis, but only if you make prior arrangements with the instructor. However, you should have a good reason for doing so. You need a written consent from the instructor for making up exams, assignments or projects. It is your responsibility to get your projects and assignments done on time. Be sure to work far enough in advance to avoid unexpected problems, such as illness, unreliable or overloaded computer systems, etc.</p>
            <h3>Appealing Grades</h3> After each exam, assignment, and/or project is graded, you have 7 calendar days to appeal your grade. All your appeals should be provided in writing. If after appealing you are still not satisfied, please visit the instructor. If you have questions about an exam, an assignment or a project grade, please visit the instructor directly.</p>

        <!-- <section class="data" id="cheating" data-section-name="cheating">
            <h1>Cheating</h1>
            <p>Each project or assignment must be the sole work of the student turning it in. Projects and assignments will be closely monitored, and students may be asked to explain suspicious similarities with any write-up or piece of code available. The following are guidelines on what cheating is and is not: </p>
            <p><b>What is cheating?</b>
                <br/>
                <br/> 1. Sharing code or other electronic files: either by copying, retyping, looking at, or supplying a copy of a file.
                <br/> 2. Sharing written assignments: either by re-writing, looking at, or supplying a copy of an assignment.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <b>What is NOT cheating?</b>
                <br/>
                <br/> 1. Clarifying ambiguities or vague points in class handouts.
                <br/> 2. Helping others use the computer systems, networks, compilers, debuggers, profilers, or other system facilities.
                <br/> 3. Helping others with high-level design issues.
                <br/> 4. Helping others debug their codes.
                <br/>
                <br/> Consequently, be aware of what constitutes cheating (and what does not) when interacting with your colleague students. Same rules of cheating as above apply when collaborating with other students. In short, you cannot share written assignments, code, and/or other electronic files with other students. If you are unsure, ask the teaching staff. Finally, be sure to store your work in protected directories. The penalty for cheating is severe, and might jeopardize your whole career as a student - cheating is not worth the trouble. By cheating in the course, you are cheating yourself; the worst outcome of cheating is missing an opportunity to learn. Besides, you will be removed from the course and assigned a failing grade. We also place a record of the incident in your permanent university profile.

            <h4>Learning Disabilities</h4>
            <p>Carnegie Mellon University is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for all persons with disabilities. To access accommodation services you are expected to initiate the request and submit a Voluntary Disclosure of Disability Form to the office of Health & Wellness or CaPS-Q. In order to receive services/accommodations, verification of a disability is required as recommended in writing by a doctor, licensed psychologist or psycho-educational specialist. The office of Health & Wellness, CaPS-Q and Office of Disability Resources in Pittsburgh will review the information you provide. All information will be considered confidential and only released to appropriate persons on a need to know basis. Once the accommodations have been approved, you will be issued a Summary of Accommodations Memorandum documenting the disability and describing the accommodation. You are responsible for providing the Memorandum to your professors at the beginning of each semester. For more information on policies and procedures, please visit <a href="https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/qword/student-affairs/office-of-health-and-wellness/assistance-for-individuals-with-disabilities/" target="_blank">this document</a>.

            <h4>Taking Care of Yourself</h4>
            <p>Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, getting enough sleep, and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.
                <br/>
                <br/> If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS-Q) is here to help: call 4454 8525 or make an appointment to see the counselor by emailing student-counselling@qatar.cmu.edu. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty, or family member you trust for help.
                <br/>
                <br/> If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call someone immediately, day or night, at 5554-7913.
                <br/>
                <br/> If the situation is life threatening, call 999.
