        <p>For urgent communication with the instructor and the teaching assistant, it is best to send an email (preferred) or give a phone call. If you want to talk to any of them in person, remember that their posted office hours are merely nominal times when they guarantee that they will be in their offices. You are always welcome to visit them outside of their office hours if you need help or want to talk about the course. </p>
        <br/>
        <p>We ask that you follow a few simple guidelines. The instructor normally works with his office door being open. Whenever the office door is open, he welcomes visits from students. However, if his office door is closed, this means that he is busy with meetings or phone calls, thus prefers not to be disturbed.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>We will use the course webpage as the central repository for all information about the class. Through the webpage, you can: </p>
        <br/>
        <ol>
            <li>Obtain copies of any handouts or assignments. This is especially useful if you miss a class or lose a document. </li>
            <li>View announcements that relate to the course. </li>
            <li>Find links to any electronic data you need for your assignments. </li>
            <li>Read clarifications and changes made to any assignments, schedules, or policies. </li>
        </ol>
        <!-- <p>Lastly, you can use Piazza for asking questions and receiving answers without all the emails! Posting your questions on Piazza will help the whole class benefit and will certainly avoid redundancy.

                <h1>15-440 Distributed Systems (Fall 2022)</h1>
                <h3>About the Course</h3>
                <p>15-440 is an introductory course in distributed systems. The emphasis will be on the techniques for creating functional, usable, and high-performing distributed systems. To make the issues more concrete, the class includes several multi-week projects requiring significant design and implementation.</p>

                <p>The goals of this course are twofold: First, students will gain an understanding of the principles and paradigms that underlay distributed systems, such as communication across networks, concurrency, synchronization, consistency and fault-tolerance. Second, students will gain practical experience in designing, implementing, and debugging real distributed systems.</p>

                <p>The major themes this course will teach include process distribution, communication, naming, abstraction and modularity, concurrency, scheduling, resource sharing, locking, consistency and replication, failure handling, distributed programming models, distributed file systems, virtualization, and the use of instrumentation, monitoring and debugging tools to solve problems at large-scale. As the creation and management of software systems are fundamental goals of any undergraduate systems course, students will design, implement, and debug large programming projects. Students will learn some of today’s most popular distributed systems, such as Google File System, MapReduce and PowerGraph.</p>

            <h3>Guidelines on Video Usage (For the Remore Instruction Phase)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><b> Videos Shall Be on During Live Sessions, Except for Pedagogical or Technical Reasons:</b>
                    In this semester, we will use Zoom during regular class sessions to deliver lectures and/or conduct recitations. You are required to turn your camera on during every online class session unless there is a pedagogical or technical reason to have it turned off. If you have justifiable technical or personal circumstances that prevent you from having your video on during live class sessions, you will need to submit a “Waiver Form” to the Video Policy Committee at https://it.qatar.cmu.edu/forms/student-video-waiver-form/. In this waiver, you will have to explain thoroughly the reasons for which you are requesting a video exemption. The waiver, once approved by the Committee, will grant you an exemption from having your camera on during the regular class time. Please note that this waiver does not apply for examinations (in-term or final exams, or presentations that require the use of video)—more on this below. After the waiver deadline submission time, if you are not granted an exemption and if you keep your video off during classes, you will lose points for in-class attendance and participation. Please keep in mind that upon approval of the Waiver Form, the professor might need to call on you periodically with questions or comments using the microphone or the chat option to ensure your presence and involvement in class.
                    Having your video on and participating during live Zoom sessions will support your learning in various ways. It may reduce the feeling of isolation and keep you connected with your colleagues and the professor. It is also important to note that everyone’s “remote classroom” and “learning” experience is greatly improved if every student is “visible”. The professor will work tirelessly to engage with you and provide a rich, interactive, and high-quality remote teaching experience. Likewise, he expects a similar commitment on your side.

                    You are also encouraged to follow the same classroom etiquette as you would during normal in-person class sessions when connecting to virtual classes – such as: dressing up appropriately, participating when required (whether by using your audio or the chat feature on Zoom), staying engaged, and avoiding any parallel work irrelevant to the session that may be distracting and affecting others learning experience to (including emails, browsing the internet, usage of the Zoom private chat with friends). Paying attention during online sessions and contributing to discussions and questions may influence your in-class participation grades.

                    In order to feel more comfortable in the Zoom environment and to address privacy concerns, adding a virtual background may be an alternative option to shield away from your surroundings. Establishing a neutral “workspace” in your environment that is away from distractions also helps with your learning process.
                </li><br/><br/>



                <li><b>Video During Quizzes and Exams:</b>
                You are required to turn your camera on during all online assessments, including quizzes, exams and the final. Your work surface, including your hands, must be visible by video at all times during examinations. No alternative arrangements will be provided to you for this request. It is important to note that if you have a physical disability that presents a barrier to abiding by these guidelines, adjustments to this policy may be made, but must first be discussed with and approved by Catherine Getchell (getchell@cmu.edu) from the Office of Disability Resources, in consultation with the professor.</li><br/><br/>

                <li><b>Unauthorized Recordings:</b>
                It is extremely important to note that students are not permitted to make any personal audio or video recordings or take photos/ screenshots of classes or presentations. Any recording of live Zoom sessions, audio, and photos/ screenshots by students, and/or posting or sharing by any means (including emails, social media platforms, phones, etc.) will be a violation of university policy and could result in serious consequences, including suspension or expulsion upon review through the community standards process.</li><br/><br/>

                <li><b>Sharing of Screens:</b>
                You may be invited to share your Screen during class. Please note that when you share your screen through zoom, your video does not turn on, and your face does not appear: what will be shared is the appropriate file or your entire desktop at any point in time. Please be mindful that any items on your desktop or computer screen (e.g. files, icons, open applications) that you do not want others to see should be removed or closed prior to sharing your screen.</li><br/><br/>

                <li><b>Remote Attendance:</b>
                The professor may use the time you log/Zoom into a class with your Andrew ID as proof of attendance. Joining after a live session’s scheduled start time will be considered as an absence. The professor may request additional proof of participation: polls, participation in chat, and requests that the students unmute their microphones and use the audio at any point in time of the Zoom lecture. The professor will consider your failure to respond as sufficient to mark you absent or late.</li><br/><br/>

            <h1>Course Assessment</h1>
            <p>The participation of students in the course will involve five forms of activities:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Attending lectures and recitations</li>
                <li>Solving assignments (including writing and reading assignments)</li>
                <li>Solving large programming projects</li>
                <li>Taking exams and quizzes</li>
                <li>Participating in class discussions</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Final Grade Assignment and Assessment methods</h3>
            <p>To this end, the below table shows the breakdown of the five forms of activities that the course involves, alongside the quantity and the overall weight of each activity. Take into account that small differences in scores can make the difference between two letter grades. Letter grades will be determined by absolute standards. The total score will be plotted as a histogram. Cutoff points are determined by examining the quality of students' work on the borderlines. Individual cases, especially those near the cutoff points may be adjusted upward or downward based on factors such as attendance, class participation, improvement observed throughout the course, exam performance, and special circumstances</p>

            <p>Because of the importance of understanding both the theoretical and hands-on elements of the class, <b>students must pass both components of the course </b>(projects as one component, and exams, quizzes and problem sets as the second) in order to receive a passing grade for the course. This does not affect the actual letter grade assignment unless one of the components is not completed to a passing standard.</p>

            <p>You are encouraged to submit the projects on time. For all projects except the final one, the following rules apply:
                <p/>
                <ul>
                    <li> If you submit one day late, we will deduct 25% of the project score as a penalty. </li>
                    <li>If you submit two days late, 50% will be deducted. </li>
                    <li>The project will not be graded (and you will receive a zero score on it) if you are more than two days late. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Grace days</h4>
                <p>There is a grace-days quota for projects. In particular, you will be given <b>3</b> grace days for all projects, except for the final one. You can use the grace days as needed. For instance, you can submit your first project three days late and still receive no penalty. In this case, you will be penalized starting from the 4th day after the deadline. Furthermore, when you consume all your grace days, you will be left with no grace days for the rest of the projects.</p>
                <br/>

                <h4>Final project</h4>

                <p>Note that the final project is unique in two aspects. First, you cannot cannot use grace days for it. As such, if you are left with some grace days before the final project, you will lose them all. Hence, plan how to utilize your grace-days quota judiciously.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Second, there will not be any penalty system for this project either. More precisely, if you are one day late in submitting the project, it will not be graded and you will receive a zero score on it.</p>

            <h1>Policies</h1>
            <h3>Working Alone on Assignments/Projects</h3>
            <p>Assignments/projects that are assigned to students should be performed individually. This course does not include any team projects or assignments.</p>

            <h3>Handing in Assignments/Projects</h3>
            <p>All assignments/projects are due at 11:59PM (one minute before midnight) on the specified due date. All submissions are electronic and should be submitted using <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/410924" target="_blank">Gradescope</a>'s course page. </p>
            <p>
                Refer to the following link for how to submit your solutions to Gradescope: <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/get_started#student-submission" target="_blank">https://www.gradescope.com/get_started#student-submission</a>
            </p>

            <h3>Making up Exams, Assignments and Projects</h3>
            <p>Missed exams, assignments and projects can be made up on a case by case basis, but only if you make prior arrangements with the instructor. However, you should have a good reason for doing so. You need a written consent from the instructor for making up exams, assignments or projects. It is your responsibility to get your projects and assignments done on time. Be sure to work far enough in advance to avoid unexpected problems, such as illness, unreliable or overloaded computer systems, etc.</p>
            <h3>Appealing Grades</h3> After each exam, assignment, and/or project is graded, you have 7 calendar days to appeal your grade. All your appeals should be provided in writing. If after appealing you are still not satisfied, please visit the instructor. If you have questions about an exam, an assignment or a project grade, please visit the instructor directly.</p>

        <!-- <section class="data" id="cheating" data-section-name="cheating">
            <h1>Cheating</h1>
            <p>Each project or assignment must be the sole work of the student turning it in. Projects and assignments will be closely monitored, and students may be asked to explain suspicious similarities with any write-up or piece of code available. The following are guidelines on what cheating is and is not: </p>
            <p><b>What is cheating?</b>
                <br/>
                <br/> 1. Sharing code or other electronic files: either by copying, retyping, looking at, or supplying a copy of a file.
                <br/> 2. Sharing written assignments: either by re-writing, looking at, or supplying a copy of an assignment.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <b>What is NOT cheating?</b>
                <br/>
                <br/> 1. Clarifying ambiguities or vague points in class handouts.
                <br/> 2. Helping others use the computer systems, networks, compilers, debuggers, profilers, or other system facilities.
                <br/> 3. Helping others with high-level design issues.
                <br/> 4. Helping others debug their codes.
                <br/>
                <br/> Consequently, be aware of what constitutes cheating (and what does not) when interacting with your colleague students. Same rules of cheating as above apply when collaborating with other students. In short, you cannot share written assignments, code, and/or other electronic files with other students. If you are unsure, ask the teaching staff. Finally, be sure to store your work in protected directories. The penalty for cheating is severe, and might jeopardize your whole career as a student - cheating is not worth the trouble. By cheating in the course, you are cheating yourself; the worst outcome of cheating is missing an opportunity to learn. Besides, you will be removed from the course and assigned a failing grade. We also place a record of the incident in your permanent university profile.

            <h4>Learning Disabilities</h4>
            <p>Carnegie Mellon University is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for all persons with disabilities. To access accommodation services you are expected to initiate the request and submit a Voluntary Disclosure of Disability Form to the office of Health & Wellness or CaPS-Q. In order to receive services/accommodations, verification of a disability is required as recommended in writing by a doctor, licensed psychologist or psycho-educational specialist. The office of Health & Wellness, CaPS-Q and Office of Disability Resources in Pittsburgh will review the information you provide. All information will be considered confidential and only released to appropriate persons on a need to know basis. Once the accommodations have been approved, you will be issued a Summary of Accommodations Memorandum documenting the disability and describing the accommodation. You are responsible for providing the Memorandum to your professors at the beginning of each semester. For more information on policies and procedures, please visit <a href="https://scotty.qatar.cmu.edu/qword/student-affairs/office-of-health-and-wellness/assistance-for-individuals-with-disabilities/" target="_blank">this document</a>.

            <h4>Taking Care of Yourself</h4>
            <p>Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, getting enough sleep, and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.
                <br/>
                <br/> If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS-Q) is here to help: call 4454 8525 or make an appointment to see the counselor by emailing student-counselling@qatar.cmu.edu. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty, or family member you trust for help.
                <br/>
                <br/> If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call someone immediately, day or night, at 5554-7913.
                <br/>
                <br/> If the situation is life threatening, call 999.
